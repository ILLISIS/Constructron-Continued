Version: 1.0.37
Date: 2022-10-20
  Changed:
    - Additional changes to deconstruct_done behaviour.
    - Added a graceful wrapup of deconstruction jobs when the inventory has no remaining free slots. Instead of the job carrying on like normal, the Constructron will walk back to the station and queue another job.
    - Changed build_done check behaviour. It now checks if there is more to build in the area instead of only basing it off the bot statuses.
    - Changed upgrade_done check behaviour. It now checks if there is more to build in the area instead of only basing it off the bot statuses.
    - Removed overally verbose logging from pathfinder.
    - Added Dynamic Robot Queues to optional mods. This is an excelent companion mod to increase bot throughput without any changes to the game and minimal performance loss. https://mods.factorio.com/mod/dynamic-robot-queues
    - [SE] Added "Cannot be placed on:" description in Constructron tooltip. - Thanks Stringweasel!

  Changed:
    - New, hopefully more fitting and unique, mod thumbnail.

  Known issues:
    - After job time out, Constructrons will attempt to finish the build or deconstruction queue even if the inventory is full.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.0.18
Date: 2022-04-03
  Experimental:
    - Added the ability to construct landfill and landfill like tiles! READ NOTES!
  Improvements:
    - Reregistered and recounted all entities on all surfaces to reduce the chances of crashes occuring from entites previously placed on older versions of the mod.
    - Added force checks to various actions such as construct, deconstruct and upgrade to accomodate AbandonedRuins mod and Auto-Deconstruct mod.
    - Added force to chunk checks so other forces entities will not be considered when a ghost is placed from another force.
    - Expanded minimum chunk check range so item-request-proxies / missing modules would be found in single entity construction if they got missed somehow.
  Fixes:
    - Various crashes due to lack of entity validation.
  Notes:
    - Landfill can be enabled or disabled through the mod settings menu.
    - Landfill functionality is highly experimental and does not represent the finished product.
    - Landfill is best constructed in small jobs close to the shore. It is highly recommended to have atleast a few Constructrons placed.
    - Constructrons will obviously not be able to reach entities/tiles in the middle of a lake and will cause Construnctrons to become stuck if this is done.
    - Constructing landfill will likely cause inefficient behaviour of Constructrons until the job is complete.
  Known issues:
    - After job time out, Constructrons will attempt to finish the build or deconstruction queue even if the inventory is full.
    - If something happens to the Constructron during an active job it continues as if nothing is wrong. There are checks in place to queue another job however.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.0.17

  Known issues:
    - After job time out, Constructrons will attempt to finish the build or deconstruction queue even if the inventory is full.
    - If something happens to the Constructron during an active job it continues as if nothing is wrong. There are checks in place to queue another job however.
    - The Landfill-like tiles are not constructed as this requires changes to the pathing calculation.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.0.16
Date: 2022-03-25
  Fixes:
    - Fixed queue backlogs that were created if a player performed an action on a lot of entities and then undone the changes
  Known issues:
    - After job time out, Constructrons will attempt to finish the build or deconstruction queue even if the inventory is full.
    - If something happens to the Constructron during an active job it continues as if nothing is wrong. There are checks in place to queue another job however.
    - The Landfill-like tiles are not constructed as this requires changes to the pathing calculation.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Fixes:
    - Map mod settings now update in game.
  Notes:
    - The Constructron colour whilst performing a repair job is charcoal.
    - Any pre-existing damage on entities will not be repaired. The repair jobs are triggered by on_entity_damaged.
    - Constructrons that are already on the way to repair an entity that dies will still proceed as the job is already in progress.
    - Constructrons that are already on the way to repair an entity that gets repaired by a local robot will still proceed as the job is already in progress.
    - If you find there are too many repair jobs that are fulfilled by robots the advice is to lower the repair % or toggle the repair jobs to OFF.
  Known issues:
    - After job time out, Constructrons will attempt to finish the build or deconstruction queue even if the inventory is full.
    - If something happens to the Constructron during an active job it continues as if nothing is wrong. There are checks in place to queue another job however.

    - Added Krastorio 2 support with equipment grids in Constructrons.
  Fixes:
    - Clean up service stations and constructrons that are destroyed which will prevent crashes at various stages.
    - Clean up service stations that are removed by bots which will prevent crashes at various stages.
    - Constructrons will now retry to move into position after overshooting its destination due to moving too fast after max_jobtime is reached.
    - Constructrons will now retry to move into position after max_jobtime if a player interferes with the Contructron either by driving the Constructron or using a connected Spidertron Remote to it.
  Known issues:
    - After job time out, Constructrons will attempt to finish the build or deconstruction queue even if the inventory is full.
    - If something happens to the Constructron during an active job it continues as if nothing is wrong. There are checks in place to queue another job however.
