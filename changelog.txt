  Improvements:
    - Major job efficiency improvements because all entities are placed inside a chunk before it can be released as a job.
    - Optimizations, when different things are idle they are now disabled and awoken when needed.
    - Pathfinder speed & performance attempt was re-introduced when not on a landfill job.
    - Jobs are given to constructrons all at the same time now instead of one per second previously.
    - Constructrons will no longer roam the map just because a chunk will fit into it's inventory.

  Info:
    - The job_start_delay setting is no longer the maximum wait time before jobs get released but rather the minimum.

    - Bugfix in migration script which only occurred in older saves.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.0.19
Date: 2022-04-10
  Improvements:
    - Added a check to detect entities that may have been missed during an upgrade job.
    - Moved missed entity messages to debug instead of game chat.
    - Added a game alert when a Constructrons logistic request is not fulfilled within 30 seconds by default.
    - Added a setting to control after how long the alert is displayed.
    - Items on the ground that get marked for deconstruction will now be actioned.
    - Added a toggle option in startup settings that toggles deconstruction of items on ground.
  Bugfixes:
    - Fixed a bug that caused Rocks and trees to be excluded from deconstruction jobs.
    - Construction robots will now be cleared from inventory if the count exceeds desired_robot_count.
  Known issues:
    - After job time out, Constructrons will attempt to finish the build or deconstruction queue even if the inventory is full.
    - If something happens to the Constructron during an active job it continues as if nothing is wrong. There are checks in place to queue another job however.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.0.18
Date: 2022-04-03
  Experimental:
    - Added the ability to construct landfill and landfill like tiles! READ NOTES!
  Improvements:
    - Reregistered and recounted all entities on all surfaces to reduce the chances of crashes occuring from entites previously placed on older versions of the mod.
    - Added force checks to various actions such as construct, deconstruct and upgrade to accomodate AbandonedRuins mod and Auto-Deconstruct mod.
    - Added force to chunk checks so other forces entities will not be considered when a ghost is placed from another force.
    - Expanded minimum chunk check range so item-request-proxies / missing modules would be found in single entity construction if they got missed somehow.
  Bugfixes:
    - Various crashes due to lack of entity validation.
  Info:
    - Landfill can be enabled or disabled through the mod settings menu.
    - Landfill functionality is highly experimental and does not represent the finished product.
    - Landfill is best constructed in small jobs close to the shore. It is highly recommended to have atleast a few Constructrons placed.
    - Constructrons will obviously not be able to reach entities/tiles in the middle of a lake and will cause Construnctrons to become stuck if this is done.
    - Constructing landfill will likely cause inefficient behaviour of Constructrons until the job is complete.
  Known issues:
    - After job time out, Constructrons will attempt to finish the build or deconstruction queue even if the inventory is full.
    - If something happens to the Constructron during an active job it continues as if nothing is wrong. There are checks in place to queue another job however.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.0.17

  Bugfixes:
    - Fixed job assignment function exit when previous surfaces had no available Constructrons.
  Known issues:
    - After job time out, Constructrons will attempt to finish the build or deconstruction queue even if the inventory is full.
    - If something happens to the Constructron during an active job it continues as if nothing is wrong. There are checks in place to queue another job however.
    - The Landfill-like tiles are not constructed as this requires changes to the pathing calculation.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.0.16
Date: 2022-03-25
  Bugfixes:
    - Fixed queue backlogs that were created if a player performed an action on a lot of entities and then undone the changes
  Known issues:
    - After job time out, Constructrons will attempt to finish the build or deconstruction queue even if the inventory is full.
    - If something happens to the Constructron during an active job it continues as if nothing is wrong. There are checks in place to queue another job however.
    - The Landfill-like tiles are not constructed as this requires changes to the pathing calculation.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Bugfixes:
    - Map mod settings now update in game.
  Info:
    - The Constructron colour whilst performing a repair job is charcoal.
    - Any pre-existing damage on entities will not be repaired. The repair jobs are triggered by on_entity_damaged.
    - Constructrons that are already on the way to repair an entity that dies will still proceed as the job is already in progress.
    - Constructrons that are already on the way to repair an entity that gets repaired by a local robot will still proceed as the job is already in progress.
    - If you find there are too many repair jobs that are fulfilled by robots the advice is to lower the repair % or toggle the repair jobs to OFF.
  Known issues:
    - After job time out, Constructrons will attempt to finish the build or deconstruction queue even if the inventory is full.

    - Constructrons will now retry move actions after a few seconds instead of max_jobtime.
    - Constructrons and Service Stations are now registered entities so their removal will be captured regardless of how they are removed.

    - Added Krastorio 2 support with equipment grids in Constructrons.
  Bugfixes:
    - Clean up service stations and constructrons that are destroyed which will prevent crashes at various stages.
    - Clean up service stations that are removed by bots which will prevent crashes at various stages.
    - Constructrons will now retry to move into position after overshooting its destination due to moving too fast after max_jobtime is reached.
    - Constructrons will now retry to move into position after max_jobtime if a player interferes with the Contructron either by driving the Constructron or using a connected Spidertron Remote to it.
  Known issues:
