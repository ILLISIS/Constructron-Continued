  Improvements:
    - Major job efficiency improvements because all entities are placed inside a chunk before it can be released as a job.
    - Optimizations, when different things are idle they are now disabled and awoken when needed.
    - Pathfinder speed & performance attempt was re-introduced when not on a landfill job.
    - Jobs are given to constructrons all at the same time now instead of one per second previously.
    - Constructrons will no longer roam the map just because a chunk will fit into it's inventory.

  Info:
    - The job_start_delay setting is no longer the maximum wait time before jobs get released but rather the minimum.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.0.18
Date: 2022-04-03
  Experimental:
    - Added the ability to construct landfill and landfill like tiles! READ NOTES!
  Improvements:

    - Added force checks to various actions such as construct, deconstruct and upgrade to accomodate AbandonedRuins mod and Auto-Deconstruct mod.
    - Added force to chunk checks so other forces entities will not be considered when a ghost is placed from another force.
    - Expanded minimum chunk check range so item-request-proxies / missing modules would be found in single entity construction if they got missed somehow.
  Bugfixes:
    - Various crashes due to lack of entity validation.
  Info:
    - Landfill can be enabled or disabled through the mod settings menu.
    - Landfill functionality is highly experimental and does not represent the finished product.
    - Landfill is best constructed in small jobs close to the shore. It is highly recommended to have atleast a few Constructrons placed.
    - Constructrons will obviously not be able to reach entities/tiles in the middle of a lake and will cause Construnctrons to become stuck if this is done.
    - Constructing landfill will likely cause inefficient behaviour of Constructrons until the job is complete.
  Known issues:
    - After job time out, Constructrons will attempt to finish the build or deconstruction queue even if the inventory is full.
    - If something happens to the Constructron during an active job it continues as if nothing is wrong. There are checks in place to queue another job however.

    - Constructrons that are already on the way to repair an entity that dies will still proceed as the job is already in progress.
    - Constructrons that are already on the way to repair an entity that gets repaired by a local robot will still proceed as the job is already in progress.
    - If you find there are too many repair jobs that are fulfilled by robots the advice is to lower the repair % or toggle the repair jobs to OFF.
  Known issues:
    - After job time out, Constructrons will attempt to finish the build or deconstruction queue even if the inventory is full.
    - If something happens to the Constructron during an active job it continues as if nothing is wrong. There are checks in place to queue another job however.

    - Added Krastorio 2 support with equipment grids in Constructrons.
  Bugfixes:
    - Clean up service stations and constructrons that are destroyed which will prevent crashes at various stages.
    - Clean up service stations that are removed by bots which will prevent crashes at various stages.
    - Constructrons will now retry to move into position after overshooting its destination due to moving too fast after max_jobtime is reached.
    - Constructrons will now retry to move into position after max_jobtime if a player interferes with the Contructron either by driving the Constructron or using a connected Spidertron Remote to it.
  Known issues:
    - After job time out, Constructrons will attempt to finish the build or deconstruction queue even if the inventory is full.
    - If something happens to the Constructron during an active job it continues as if nothing is wrong. There are checks in place to queue another job however.
    - The Landfill tile is not constructed as this requires changes to the pathing calculation.
